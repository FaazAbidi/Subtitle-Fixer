# Subtitle-Fixer

It is a python program to Sync subtitles. The core concept of this project is to manipulate with .srt files. 

Few Guidlines to use the GUI:

1. srt file, the video file and this program should be in the same directory. The program does not asks to browse the drive. 
2. Input format should the same as written in the GUI window. 
3. Don't press the forward or backward button first. Srt file needs to be imported before syncing. 

Few More Things:

The current program does not manipulate the original srt file. It creates a new file named, 'fixed_subtitle.srt', according to your changes in time. To view the changes, you have to import that file into your video player. 

Bugs and Issues:

1. For large files and longer videos, it takes some time.
